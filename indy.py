print "Basic instructions programming languages"
print "- Input, get data example; keyboard"
print "- Output, display data example; to screen"
print "- Math, basic mathematical operations"
print "- Conditional excution, check conditions and excute appropriately"
print "- Repetition, Perform action reapetdly with some variation"
print "Two kinds of programs processes high-level into low level languages"
print "1. Interpreters, sourcecode -> output. processes al little at a time"
print "2. Compilers, translates sourcecode completely before running to objectcode/executable. Once compiled it can run without translation"
print "Different Errors"
print "1. Semantic errors, program will run but does not do what you want it to do"
print "2. Runtime errors, program will not run, are also called exceptions, rare in simple programs"
print "3. Syntax errors, code is not correctly formatted"
print "Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations"
